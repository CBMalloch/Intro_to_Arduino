Learning Objectives
	How can I observe stuff with an Arduino?
	How can I control stuff with an Arduino?
	
observe - compute - control - repeat forever

Observe - like what?
	Voltages, ultimately. Examples: temperature, pressure, flow rates, signal strength, elapsed time.
	Sensors: switches, potentiometers, I2C, RTCs, 
Compute - like what?
	EU conversion, FFT, PID, fuzzy logic, finite state automata
Control - like what?
	Voltages, ultimately. Specifically on-off and PWM.
	Actuators: motors (stepper, DC, servo), amplifiers (mechanical relays, SSR, H-bridge), heating elements

What is a microcontroller?
	A microcomputer (microprocessor and memory) combined with input/output circuitry and timers
	Look inside your car; your dishwasher, your microwave, your cell phone, your little brother's toys, â€¦
	
Introduction to Atmel AVR chip
Introduction to Arduino
	Open-source hardware and software "Wiring" (also Google "Processing") which provides a simple environment for using the AVR chip
	Wiring language is halfway between C and C++

Programming the Arduino
	Open Arduino
	Program blink (use examples)
	Load program
	It starts running automatically
	
Observe something
	Hello world pot
	
Control something
	LED brightness via pot
	monitor with Serial.print commands
	
Things to bring in:
	Old Macintoshes, including USB cables
	stickers for TTL-232 cables
	
Things to do:
	find out where to store programs and presentation
	
Tickler (sent):

Learn how to use simple and inexpensive microcontrollers to sense and control aspects of the real world! You will be introduced to the Arduino environment, which comprises a c++ -like programming language, the microprocessor, and the means to communicate with it and send it programs. The basics include running a simple program to flash an LED, reading the position of a variable resistor, and controlling the LED's brightness using analog output.
